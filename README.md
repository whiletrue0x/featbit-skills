Skills, deployment guides, and SDK integration knowledge for AI coding agents working with [FeatBit](https://featbit.co) — an open-source feature flags and A/B testing platform.

## Quick Start

> **Prerequisite**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16+ is required to run `npx`.

```bash
npx skills add featbit/featbit-skills
```

The wizard will detect your installed AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, etc.) and let you select which skills to install. No configuration needed.

```bash
# Install specific skills only
npx skills add featbit/featbit-skills --skill featbit-sdks-dotnet --skill featbit-deployment-docker

# Install to a specific agent
npx skills add featbit/featbit-skills -a claude-code

# List all available skills without installing
npx skills add featbit/featbit-skills --list
```

> Skills are installed to your agent's skills directory (e.g., `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code, `.agents/skills/` for Cursor/Copilot). The CLI supports 40+ agents — see [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) for the full list.

## What's Inside

| | |
|---|---|
| 17 Skills | SDK integration, deployment, API, and platform knowledge |
| 7 Languages | .NET, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, JavaScript, React / React Native |
| 3 Deployment targets | Docker Compose, Kubernetes/Helm, AWS ECS Fargate |

Use skills selectively. Loading all skills when only one is relevant wastes context tokens and dilutes agent attention.
