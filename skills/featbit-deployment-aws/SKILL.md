# FeatBit on AWS

## Recommended Deployment Options

**Option 1 — ECS Fargate + Terraform (recommended baseline)**
The official [featbit-terraform-aws](https://github.com/featbit/featbit-terraform-aws) project provides a ready-to-use Terraform setup for deploying FeatBit on AWS ECS Fargate with ALB, Aurora PostgreSQL, and ElastiCache. This is the recommended starting point for most AWS deployments.

**Option 2 — AWS Kubernetes (EKS)**
For teams already running Kubernetes on AWS, use the Helm chart approach instead.
👉 See the **featbit-deployment-kubernetes** skill for full guidance.

## Q: Can I run multiple ECS Fargate tasks for High Availability?

**A:** Yes. All four FeatBit services (`ui`, `api-server`, `evaluation-server`, `data-analytics-server`) are stateless and support multiple concurrent instances. Place an ALB in front of each service first, then increase the task count.

Note the distinction: running multiple tasks in the **same AZ** improves **fault tolerance** (a crashed task is replaced while others keep serving traffic), but it is not true **High Availability**. For HA, tasks must span multiple subnets in different AZs so the service survives an entire AZ (Availability Zone) going down.

Not all services are equally critical — `evaluation-server` and `api-server` have direct user impact if they go down and should be scaled first. `ui` only affects the portal. `data-analytics-server` only affects analytics; flags keep working without it.
